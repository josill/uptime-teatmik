## Notes

appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json are filled automatically using a bash script called launchsettings.sh in the root directory. For this to work we also need a .env file in the root directory with the following information:

```
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=

BR_USERNAME=
BR_PASSWORD=
BR_CHANGES_URL=
```
